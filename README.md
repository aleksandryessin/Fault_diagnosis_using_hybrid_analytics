# Fault_diagnosis_using_hybrid_analytics
The purpose of this project is to generate the methodology for prescriptive analytics of dynamic equipment using hybrid modeling. The methodology allows predicting a specific place of that malfunction and its numeric value of the malfunction parameter.   As an example of a dynamic system, the Industrial Gas Turbine is investigated. This project aims to use generated data of the real malfunction parameters for Oil and Hydraulic subsystems using mathematical modeling and then to build the regression model for predicting the index technical state (ITS) of each of the malfunctions.
